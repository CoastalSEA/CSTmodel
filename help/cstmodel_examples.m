%% CSTmodel Example Folder
% A selection of data sets can be found in the example folder
% <matlab:cst_example_folder here>, along with a demo.mat file that contains an 
% example model bassed loosely on the Humber estuary.
% 
% In addition, there are four text files that illustrate the format when
% loading observations to compare with the model and when using actual
% rather than modelled width and CSA data. The files are:
%%
% * _demo_Uobs.txt_ - a file containing tidal velocities for distances along
% the channel at intervals through a tidal cycle (i.e. u(x,t)).
% * _demo_Zobs.txt_ - a file containing water level elevations for distances along
% the channel at intervals through a tidal cycle (i.e. u(x,t)).
% * _demo_Xobs.txt_ - a file containing tidal properties for distances along
% the channel, including mean tide level, tidal amplitude, velocity 
% amplitude and hydraulic depth (e.g. a(x)).
% * _demo_estuary_props.txt_ - a file containing Cross-section area at mean 
% tide level and widths at high and low at intervals along the channel. 
% A spacially varying Manning coefficient can also be included.
