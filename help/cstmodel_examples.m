%% CSTmodel Example Folder
% A selection of data sets can be found in the example folder
% <matlab:cst_example_folder here>, along with a demo.mat file that contains an 
% example model based loosely on the Humber estuary.
% 
% In addition, there are three text files that illustrate the format when
% loading observations to compare with the model and when using actual
% rather than modelled width and CSA data. The files are:
%%
% * _demo_Fobs.txt_ - a file containing Cross-section area and hydraulic depth
% at mean tide level, widths at high and low at intervals along the channel
% and an optional spacially varying Manning coefficient.
% * _demo_Uobs.txt_ - a file containing tidal velocities for distances along
% the channel at intervals through a tidal cycle (i.e. u(x,t)).
% * _demo_Zobs.txt_ - a file containing water level elevations for distances along
% the channel at intervals through a tidal cycle (i.e. z(x,t)).
% amplitude and hydraulic depth (e.g. a(x)).
